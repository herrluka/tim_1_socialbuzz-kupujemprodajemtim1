# EBazaar with the social network elements

ASP .NET core project realized for the purposes of class Information systems develpment management. Aim: create system backend that is based on microservices architecture. Document endpoints with Swagger.

First, database schema war created. After that, our mission was to identify microservices using projected DB schema. Considering very limited amount of time, we decided to use synchronous communication between services. We relied on HTTPS protocol to protect our tokens and secret key which ensure inter-services communication.

My task was creation of Trasnport and Recommendation services.
